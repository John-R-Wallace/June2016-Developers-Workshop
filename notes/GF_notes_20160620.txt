Kasper - GPU, nvidia - canyou get things to work on the GPUs

Examples: How to turn your ADMB model into TMB

JI: generic methods for cross validation

JT: TMB helper library that can provide functions to assist non-power users (e.g. doing phases)


## Anders Nielsen's presentation: Joint TMB/ADMB development
is it easier to extend ADMB or TMB?
notes will supplement presentation, sasume slides are available
sub-sweeping: Kasper: idea is to do some optimization of sweeps
JI: auto generator?  AN: think about a beta function. Just give density. e.g. the integrate function. But more general.
- BB: Doing a template?
- KK: dealing with requests - (can I get the p_myfavoritedistribution?) - generic solution.
- JT: another option is user contributed density functions, place to house these?
- KK: addresses a different problem, when can write down density it is easy. Sometimes not too easy - users might not want to do this.
- you give it the prob density, it gives you the cumulative
- BB: could do an ODE, checkpoint it. consider cumulative a soultion of the ode. 
- MB: perhaps use runge-kutta
* example with pbeta.
vectorize macro in TMB to generate combinations of vector/scalars for functions
JI: does this generalize to matrices and arrays, etc.
AN: not yet, but it could...
AN: Have implemented new ADMB function, add VECTORIZE(my_new_fun)

example pbeta in TMB
KK: challenging to implement a genraly purpose integrator for beta, too imprecise.
AN: currently using code from NR, goal is to do in R eventually
AN: conditional expressions - TMB not tolerant to this (e.f. if statements including parameters/derived variables)
DF: this could be an optimization choice
BB: there could be a comparison - some people tape once, then check comparisons to see if arguments have changed. Others try to code out the individual cases that come up.
features in cppad to check the tape so that you know whether what has come up does not correpsond to original algorithm
AN: tiny_ad library. feasible to do froward AD for small number of arguments.
JI: Is this where you have deriviatives inside the template
BB: tapeless?
KK: mixes reverse-forward mode for computation. Critical to conserve cheap gradient. forward mode can preserve the cheap gradient. 
BB: way to create atomic functions
JT: Can we have a Better workflow for communicating new techniques? 
AN: will be in report that will go 'somewhere'.
BB: can do the same thing with checkpoint functions in cppad.
KK: memory issue, don't want to expand ALL the operations

qbeta in ADMB
AN: renamed. some precision issue, something that was done to make it stable. new version corresponds to R.
derivatives. Compared to R numderiv(), something was awry. Underlines value of comparing multiple approaches.
Much safer using generic function rather than having indivs code derivatives themselves.
underlines need for something like tiny_ad
BB: when go to check the derivatives you can use anything to check.
AN: difficulty was getting derivatives out of ADMB
Bessel function is going to be initial instance of trying to use tiny_ad in ADMB.

BB: when writing C++ routines for special functions, he uses GSL in C, thought about having Python function that takes templated version and writes function?
KK: did manual conversion to template version for Bessel. Would be nightmare to do automatically.
DF: one thing has to be AD type, keep running thing so it tells you which things need to be ad type.
KK: issue is when have 3 inputs, not interested in computing derivatives for one.
BB: cppad make everything adtype, but parts of code can be difficult to deal with
KK: e.g. double to integer, what do you expect your ad tool to do in these instances
BB: well that will throw a compile aerror, can't do it by mistake.
KK: you'll want to review this as a developer, you don't want this to be done automatically, need to understand what is going on.
DF: still a place for people in all this.

JI: fairly low level, not at user.

BB/AN: idea is about how to add new user features.

JS: be good to look at tiny_ad code
KK: in private repo but will make available eventually.
AN: ADMB version is on his github.

BB: these atomic functions, could be an addon or cppad that people could use in general? part of the reason I did cppadmixed

# Close Anders presentation

JI: Do we need to map out overlaps  / potentials etc. of where different things fit together - where is the overlap, where things need to be carved out (e.g. tiny_ad, STAN, etc.)

JT: what about output from R, how likely is that to change - will this be documented.
KK: R output won't change. Some of the internal stuff on the C side is different, not sure this is 100% static.
BB: grow things, move things in to it as needed.
KK: intent was to use cppad as is inside TMB. But...  (sparse testing)
BB: need to do some speed testing
JT: more documentation, don;t necessariyl want to code stuff underneath, but wondering where things fit.
MB: best pratices for one example, e.g. conway/maxwell or generalized poisson, then write out experience with this. 
JT: where to house an R library that contains R code that sits on top of TMB. fairly straightforward. less clear how to contribute C++ to TMB, that is not general enough to be in TMB project, but still want it to be used.
JT: e.g. GMACS, dont want in the TMB base, but still useful to share. Is there a better way?
KK: definitely want an easy way to include your own libraries of C++ functions.

BB: when you write something do you also write documentaton on how to do this?
KK: do it with doxygen

HS/KK: easy solution to add this C++ functons, make an hpp file, and put it after TMB.
KK: set up a way where you could install it as a plugin folder within TMB.
BB: suggestion is to have a sub-namespace in TMB. 
BB: sub-namespace - way you use include files, way to keep names from conflicting with eachother
KK: perhaps have a contrib bamespace in a contrib folder somewhere, points to something that you don't get by default. in principle easy - just need to decide what is way we want to do this.
JI: contributed libraries shoul be separate - use at your own risk type
BB: separate repo, but gets installed into TMB include at install.
JT: maybe have an R function that downlaods a file and puts it where it needs to be.
MB: perhaps take advantage of devtools to grab code, and then another function that puts it in include folder.
KK: create a contrib folder that's dedicated to putting in these contributed libraries. Modify compile functions in TMB to include everything within contrib folder.



### Brad Bell

cppad_mixed examples, capture_xam.cpp

JT: what is advantages of using cppad_mixed vs.  doing cppad and use TMB to do mixed effects bit.

gsl is the gnu scientific library



Wednesday BBQ @ JI house


### Mollie Brooks, glmmTMB  'glim tim'

JT: spatiotemporal packacge that is replicating / trying to do similar things to glmmTMB

Could be very useful for Alex Hansell and others

lmer 5x faster than glmmTMB for gaussian,  for count data glmmTMB 2.3x faaster than glmer

future additions:
last one is increse stability?
CB: are there problems with stability?
JT: spatialdeltaGLM, deal with biomdality, one case where TMB can fall apart - u step dive towards 0. gets worse as it gets closer to MLE.
KK: problem is in laplace approximation. able to choose way of outer parameters in a way that makes random parameters flat inner likelihood.
HS: can diagnose the problem with importance sampling vs laplace approximation. to solve, need to constrain problem to avoid regions of parameter space.
JT: diagnosis of failure of laplace.
DF: want to see how unstable importance sampling is, that will tell you that laplace is not a good idea.
DF: well if normal approx is not very good, what should you do to get a better approximation

#  MB: Generalized Poisson.
Hansell: see Harris et al. 2012 Stata Journal (modeling underdispersed counts....)
JT: perhaps include Conway-Maxwell poisson
thinking about adding a dgenpois function - compare to Jim's conway-maxwell. ?
github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB

HS: weights - can be dangerous, don't get what you expect when using random effects. When are the weights applied - if included in template then weights will get wrong.
CB: changing weights is comparable to changing data, which is why you can't use AIC.
BB: have had to demonstrate that you get the same answer. modeling variances vs std devs.
MB: Should we remove the weights option? Is it that risky?
HS/JT: Yes, probably a good idea.
JT: could add in by hanf the missing part. Accomplish same stuff by modeling the dispersion term.


### Arni presentation

# ADMB IDE

lag between ADMB relesases and provision of IDE.

should make use of GCC for Rtools

JI: talk about that some more. differences between compilers
JA: use MinGW for everything. Tried Rtools but ran in to some problems.


### Jim Thorson
#Species interactions, ecsystem modeling
Granger cointegration models

#much in presentation,

Uber-model
* is anyone interested in working with JT on this?

Potential advancements
1. variational Bayes

CB: go back to orevioud DF comment - need to first know if LA is not working.
JT: asymptotically as you increase data, always favor putting in additional random effect, even with trivial effect size. simulation papers.

link to the Danes leave 1 out cross-validation

Model selection
CB: JT needs to convince folks that conditional AIC is something you need.
BB: lasso is an alternative to model selection.

general conclusion as a group: it would be nice to be able to diagnose cases where LA is not performing well.

### Brad Bell
### CppAD Mixed
not much that other than presentation
Did not capture conversation.

JT: asked about being able to make use of GPUs - does CppAD Mixed do this?
JS: Has run KK's nvblas issue, will workwith KK on whether this worked, improvements.
GF: gputools package in R contains some functions optimised for GPUs, perhaps make use of them

# final conversation
general issues about providing user support.

JI: Do we need more cases where we have same model in ADMB and TMB, best practices on what to do / what not to do in one vs the other.

List of potential breakout sessions.

- experiences with two packages
- helper library for TMB

stuff parked for today
JS, CM STAN material, MB posfun, best practice for contributing code, 


##### TUESDAY ######

### Arni,
### TMB IDE

3 versions - modes

1. tmb.el  tmb-mode
2. tmb-ide , with config file that lets emacs behave.
3. vrtual tmb: virtualbox

6gb file, currently on a server in iceland. might be good to get it here somewhere.

challenges with maintenance and learning.

KK and other developers are using tmb-mode

maintenance is fairly easy for Arni, not many files to keep track of / update
